# UnitySafetyDrills


Uncontrollable disasters can strike without warning and potentially change everything about our lives in an instant. Schools perform safety drills (fire, earthquake, tornado, etc.) in an effort to prepare posterity for these emergencies, but for various reasons fail to effectively engage the students in the valuable lessons being taught during these drills. Our goals are to simplify, optimize, and standardize the way safety drills are performed and to provide a tool to conduct an interactive, guided safety drill. We have created a virtual reality simulation that guides the user through the process of performing a fire drill in order to familiarize them with the important steps that should be taken in real circumstances. We built this simulation to be performed on any Android smartphone with the use of a basic VR headset, such as Google Cardboard. With this product, we hope to provide an educational tool that better prepares individuals on how to respond in disastrous situations.
